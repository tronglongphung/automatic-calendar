This application is about a timetable for an office worker, which lists the time from 9AM to 5PM.

Within the hours, the person can remind themselves of what they need to do in an upcoming future.

The timeline is color-coded:

- Gray for past (which will not be able to add notes)
- Red for present
- Green for future (Red and green can add notes)
